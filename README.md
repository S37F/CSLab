## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is a static web application and does not require a complex build process. You can run it locally with any simple web server.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser.
- A local web server. If you have Python installed, you can use its built-in server. Alternatively, you can use a code editor extension like [Live Server for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/s37f/CsLaB.git
    cd CslaB
    ```

2.  **Serve the files:**
    - **Using Python:**
      ```sh
      # For Python 3
      python -m http.server
      ```
    - **Using VS Code Live Server:**
      - Install the "Live Server" extension.
      - Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".

3.  **Open in browser:**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the address provided by Live Server) in your web browser.
