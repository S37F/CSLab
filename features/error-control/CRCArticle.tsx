                <p>Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) is a robust error-detecting code commonly used in digital networks and storage devices to detect accidental changes to raw data. It is highly effective at detecting common errors caused by noise in transmission channels.</p>
                <p>CRC is used in Ethernet, Wi-Fi, PCI Express, SATA, and many other communication and storage standards. The specific implementation is defined by its generator polynomial.</p>

            <Section title="Mathematical Foundation">
                <p>CRC is based on binary division (or more formally, division of polynomials over the finite field GF(2)). The data bits are treated as the coefficients of a polynomial, M(x), and are divided by a fixed, pre-defined generator polynomial, G(x). The remainder of this division is the CRC checksum.</p>
                <p>The key operation in this division is the exclusive OR (XOR), as there are no borrows or carries.</p>

                   <li><strong>Choose a Generator Polynomial (G):</strong> A generator of degree 'r' is chosen. This determines the length of the CRC code (r bits). e.g., for CRC-4, a common generator is x‚Å¥ + x + 1, or 10011 in binary.</li>
                   <li><strong>Append Zeros:</strong> Append 'r' zero bits to the end of the original data message (M). This gives the dividend.</li>
                   <li><strong>Binary Division:</strong> Divide the augmented data by the generator polynomial using binary long division (XOR).</li>
                   <li><strong>Get Remainder:</strong> The 'r'-bit remainder from this division is the CRC checksum.</li>
                   <li><strong>Transmit:</strong> The original data message is transmitted along with the CRC checksum appended to it. This forms the codeword.</li>
